/*YOUR FIRST LOOP
* Create an array named "numArray", assign it the values of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
* Create a basic for-loop that will loop through the array and print each number
*/


/*SAY HELLO
* Create a variable named "hello", assign it a value of 10
* Create a for-loop that will print "Hello" 10 times
*/


/*DOUBLE A NUMBER
* Create an array named "doubled", assign it the values of [2,4,6,8,10]
* Use a for-loop to double each number in the array and print each out
*/


/*FIND THE AVERAGE SCORE [average = total / # of scores]
* Create an array named "scores", assign it the values of [80,55,70,95,82]
* Create an array named "averageScore", assign it a value of 0
* Use a for-loop to compute an average test score based on the array values
* Print with message 'The average score is' + averageScore
*/


/*EVEN OR ODD
* Create a variable named "num", assign it a value of 10
* Use a for-loop and conditionals that will check whether the number is even or odd and
  print "The number" + number + "is even/odd"
